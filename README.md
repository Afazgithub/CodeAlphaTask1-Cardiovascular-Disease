# CodeAlphaTask1-Cardiovascular-Disease
In this task, I explored the Cardiovascular Disease dataset and tested four machine-learning algorithms: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. After comparing their performance, XGBoost proved to be the best, so it was selected for the final prediction model.
